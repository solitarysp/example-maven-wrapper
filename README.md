# Maven Wrapper

## Ongoing Migration to Apache Maven

The project codebase has been accepted to be included in the upstream Apache
Maven project itself. Currently the plan is to release the wrapper as a feature
of the upcoming Maven 3.7.0 release. For this purpose the following resources
are available:

- Maven developer mailing list for discussions
- maven-wrapper-plugin with wrapper goal to replace takari-maven-plugin at
https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/maven-wrapper-plugin.git
- Maven studies repository/ maven-wrapper branch as first code migration to be
  base of inclusion in Maven core at
  https://github.com/apache/maven-studies/tree/maven-wrapper
- Maven wrapper specific issue tracker project https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MWRAPPER/

We encourage any users and contributors to work with us within the Apache Maven
project on any further changes.

This project is essentially frozen now.

## Legacy Documentation

The Maven Wrapper is an easy way to ensure a user of your Maven build has
everything necessary to run your Maven build.

_Why might this be necessary?_ Maven to date has been very stable for users, is
available on most systems or is easy to procure: but with many of the recent
changes in Maven it will be easier for users to have a fully encapsulated build
setup provided by the project. With the Maven Wrapper this is very easy to do
and it's a great idea borrowed from Gradle.

The easiest way to setup the Maven Wrapper for your project is to use the
[Takari Maven Plugin][1] with its provided `wrapper` goal. To add or update all
the necessary Maven Wrapper files to your project execute the following command:

```bash
mvn -N io.takari:maven:0.7.7:wrapper
```

> Note: The default usage should be `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper` but for
> some users this seem to result in usage of an old version of the wrapper and
> therefore installation of older Maven defaults and so on.

Normally you instruct users to install a specific version of Apache Maven, put
it on the PATH and then run the `mvn` command like the following:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

But now, with a Maven Wrapper setup, you can instruct users to run wrapper
scripts:

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

or on Windows

```bash
mvnw.cmd clean install
```

A normal Maven build will be executed with the one important change that if the
user doesn't have the necessary version of Maven specified in
`.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties` it will be downloaded for the user
first, installed and then used.

Subsequent uses of `mvn`/`mvnw.cmd` use the previously downloaded, specific
version as needed.

## Supported Systems

The wrapper should work on various operating systems including

* Linux (numerous versions, tested on Ubuntu and CentOS)
* OSX / macOS
* Windows (various newer versions)
* Solaris (10 and 11)

For all those *nix operating systems, various shells should work including

* sh
* bash
* dash
* zsh

In terms of Apache Maven versions itself, the wrapper should work with any Maven
3.x version and it defaults to the latest release - currently 3.6.3. We do NOT
plan to support the deprecated, EOL'ed Maven 2.x.

The maven-wrapper itself is compiled to work with Java 5. The Takari Maven
Plugin for installation however uses Java 7. Once the wrapper is installed with
the plugin you should be able to use the wrapper on the project with Java 5 and
up. This is however not really tested by the committers.

## Changes

Please check out the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for more information about our
releases.

## Verbose Mode

The wrapper supports a verbose mode in which it outputs further information. It
is activated by setting the `MVNW_VERBOSE` environment variable to `true`.

By default it is off.

## Usage without Binary JAR

By default, the Maven Wrapper JAR archive is added to the using project as small
binary file `.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar`. It is used to bootstrap the
download and invocation of Maven from the wrapper shell scripts.

If your project is not allowed to contain binary files like this, you can
configure your version control system to exclude checkin/commit of the wrapper
jar.

If the JAR is not found to be available by the scripts they will attempt to
download the file from the URL specified in
`.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties` under `wrapperUrl` and put it in place.
The download is attempted via curl, wget and, as last resort, by compiling the
`./mvn/wrapper/MavenWrapperDownloader.java` file and executing the resulting
class.

If your Maven repository is password protected you can specify your username via
the environment variable `MVNW_USERNAME` and the password via the environment
variable `MVNW_PASSWORD`.

## Using a Different Version of Maven

To switch the version of Maven used to build a project you can initialize it
using:

```bash
mvn -N io.takari:maven:0.7.7:wrapper -Dmaven=3.5.4
```

which works for any version except snapshots. Once you have a wrapper you can
change its version by setting the `distributionUrl` in
`.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties`, e.g.

```bash
distributionUrl=https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/apache-maven/3.5.4/apache-maven-3.5.4-bin.zip
```

## Using Basic Authentication for Distribution Download

To download Maven from a location that requires Basic Authentication you have 2
options:

1. Set the environment variables MVNW_USERNAME and MVNW_PASSWORD

    or

2. add user and password to the distributionUrl like that:
`distributionUrl=https://username:password@<yourserver>/maven2/org/apache/maven/apache-maven/3.2.1/apache-maven-3.2.1-bin.zip`

## Specifying Maven Distribution Base Path

This is a feature of Maven itself and the wrapper just happens to take it into
account. Simply set `MAVEN_USER_HOME` to the desired path and the wrapper uses
it as the base of the Maven distro installation.

See https://www.lewuathe.com/maven-wrapper-home.html and
https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper/issues/17

## Using a Maven Repository Manager

When using an internal Maven repository manager you have two options:

1. Just set the correct URL to wrapper jar and Maven distro in
  `maven-wrapper.properties` in your project
2. Leave the default URL in the project pointing to Maven Central and set the
  environment variable `MVNW_REPOURL` to your repo manager URL such as
  `https://repo.example.com/central-repo-proxy`.

If `MVNW_REPOURL` is set during the wrapper installation with the
takari-maven-plugin, the URL is used in the maven-wrapper.properties file.

If not set, but your mirror URL in your settings.xml is configured, it will be
used.

## Developing and Releasing

To test Maven wrapper usage:

- ensure you are building on a Unix filesystem with correct mounting for
  executable flag setting
- build the maven-wrapper as snapshot version
- update version in takari-maven-plugin
- build takari-maven-plugin
- use on test project with takari-maven-plugin version

```bash
mvn -N -X io.takari:maven:0.7.7-SNAPSHOT:wrapper
```

For release

- make sure version in mvnw files, MavenWrapperDownloader.java and config files
  and pom files is new upcoming release
- cut maven release with usual release plugin usage
- update maven plugin to release version
- release it as well

Updating Maven version:

- update URL in maven-wrapper/.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties
- update URL in MavenWrapperMain
- updated DEFAULT_MAVEN_VER parameter in takari-maven-plugin  WrapperMojo class
